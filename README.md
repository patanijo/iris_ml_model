```
On OSx/Linux
```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ source activate iris_ml_model
```

How to Execute This Project
-----------

Include an example or two of how to run various cleaning or analysis tasks. This is often the first thing users and collaborators on your project will look at, so make it explicit.
